This project estimates three parameters (θ, M, X) of a parametric curve using nonlinear least squares optimization. The model is fitted to observed (x, y) data with a robust Huber loss to minimize error. Results show an accurate curve fit with θ = 28.13°, M = 0.0214, and X = 54.89, confirming strong model performance.
